# Lumberjack

A simple mod based on ideas from the mods TreeCapitator, Timber, and New Timber.
This mod allows to hit the bottom of the tree and the whole tree (wood) is harvested
and moved to the players inventory.
To distinguish between "grown" trees and playes tree nodes, the 'node.param1'
is used to identify placed nodes.
