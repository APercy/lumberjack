# Lumberjack

Mod to completely cut trees by destroying only one block.

This mod allows to destroy the bottom of the tree and the whole tree is felled
and moved to the players inventory.  
But therefore 'lumberjack' privs are needed, otherwise you have to dig the hole tree from the top.  
(prevents part of trees hanging in the air)  
To get the lumberjack privs, the player has to collect harvesting points by harvesting tree blocks and placing saplings.

This mod is based on ideas from the mods TreeCapitator, Timber, and New Timber.
